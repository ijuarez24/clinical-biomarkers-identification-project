# MasterÂ´s Thesis Project in Bioinformatics

This repository contains the code and resources for my Master's Thesis project in Bioinformatics. I am currently working on this project as part of my final academic requirement.

## Project Overview

The focus of this project is the identification of clinical markers in colorectal cancer. The ultimate goal is to improve the understanding and prediction of disease prognosis through the application of bioinformatics techniques. 

Key aspects of this project include:
- Identification of potential clinical markers in colorectal cancer using bioinformatics tools.
- Implementation of machine learning models to evaluate and predict the prognosis of the disease.

## Current Status

The project is actively under development, and the repository will be updated regularly as new results, analyses, and implementations are completed.
