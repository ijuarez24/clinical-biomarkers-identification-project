## General Information
Colorectal cancer is one of the most prevalent oncological diseases worldwide. Bioinformatics, combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning, offers new opportunities to improve its detection and prognosis. This project explores the use of these tools to advance personalized medicine and optimize patient diagnosis and treatment.

Key aspects of this project include:
- Identification of potential clinical markers in colorectal cancer using bioinformatics tools.
- Implementation of machine learning models to evaluate and predict the prognosis of the disease.
